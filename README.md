[Unified Verification Environment (UVE)](http://www.systemverilog.ch)
========================================================================

The aim of the UVE project is to create software that automatically generates
a verification testbench (TB)) written in [SystemVerilog (SV)]
(http://www.systemverilog.org/) and integrating the [UVM]
(http://www.uvmworld.org/) methodology. 

UVE makes the rapid development of a verification environment a simple process.
The generated TB is directly able to perform random actions on the DUV (design 
under verification). For this UVE provides a graphical user interface, a code
generator, compilation scripts and a library of verification IPs (VIP). One of 
the main innovations of UVE is a list of TODOs in the TB code which help in 
finalizing the TB. This is especially useful for developers not familiar with 
SV and/or UVE, but also experienced developers profit from that easy to use 
task list.

Moreover, the graphical interface lets the user observe the structure of the 
generated testbench. Files can be accessed easily by double clicking on the 
graphical view. Simulation can be launched directly from the tool.
